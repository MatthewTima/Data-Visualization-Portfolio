# Bank Marketing Campaign Visualization Portfolio

This repository showcases data visualizations created to analyze the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns and understand customer behavior related to term deposit subscriptions. The dashboards were developed using Tableau and Power BI, leveraging a dataset of over 11,000 customer records.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights for banks to optimize their marketing strategies, target the right customer segments, and improve overall campaign performance. The visualizations focus on identifying key customer profiles likely to subscribe to term deposits and assessing the impact of marketing efforts on deposit subscriptions.

## Dashboards

### Tableau: Customer Profile Dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer characteristics associated with deposit subscriptions.

* **Description:** The "Customer Profile" dashboard in Tableau presents key customer demographics and their relationship to deposit subscriptions. It uses a combination of visualizations to provide a holistic view of customer behavior.
  
* **Visualizations:**
  * **Jobs Deposit Subscription (Bar Chart):** Shows the number of deposit subscriptions by job type.
    * **Insight:** "Management" jobs have the highest number of deposit subscriptions, followed by "retired" individuals.
  * **Average Balance by Job Type (Tree Map):** Compares the average balance across different job types.
    * **Insight:** "Retired" individuals have the highest average balance, followed by "management."
  * **Subscription Education (Pie Chart):** Illustrates the distribution of customers based on their education levels and subscription status.
    * **Insight:** Provides a quick comparison of the proportion of subscribers across different education levels.
      
* **Interactive Features:**
  * **Hover Action:** Highlights related data points across all visualizations when hovering over a specific job type in the tree map.
  * **Deposit Filter:** Allows users to filter the data to show only customers who subscribed or did not subscribe to a term deposit.

**Data Insights:**

The Tableau dashboard reveals that "management" and "retired" individuals are more likely to subscribe to deposit services and maintain higher account balances. This suggests that banks can improve marketing efficiency by targeting these segments with tailored offers and communication strategies.

### Power BI: Bank Data Dashboard

This dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends related to deposit subscriptions and marketing campaign performance.

* **Description:** The "Bank Data Dashboard" in Power BI focuses on analyzing the impact of marketing campaigns on deposit subscriptions. It includes visualizations that track deposit trends over time, the effectiveness of different contact strategies, and the outcomes of marketing efforts.
* **Visualizations:**
  * **Deposit Subscription Trend Over Time (Line Chart):** Shows the trend of deposits over time.
    * **Insight:** Deposit subscriptions peak in May and decline significantly towards the end of the year.
  * **Deposit by Campaign (Contacts) (Bar Chart):** Displays the number of deposits made based on the number of times a customer was contacted.
    * **Insight:** Two contacts yield the highest number of deposits, with diminishing returns for more frequent contacts.
  * **Deposit by Poutcome, Month, and Campaign (Pie Chart):** Presents the percentage of deposits categorized by outcome (success, failure, unknown, other).
    * **Insight:** A high number of "unknown" outcomes indicate a need for improved data collection and tracking.
* **Interactive Features:**
  * **Drill Down:** Allows users to drill down into the pie chart to see the distribution of deposits by outcome, month, and campaign.
  * **Month Filter:** Enables users to filter the data by specific months.

**Data Insights:**

The Power BI dashboard reveals that there's a seasonal trend in deposit subscriptions, campaigns are most effective with two interactions, and the bank needs to refine the tracking of outcomes to better quantify the success of campaign strategies.

## Business Decisions

These dashboards support data-driven decisions by:

* **Targeted Marketing:** Identifying key customer segments (e.g., management, retired individuals) for tailored marketing campaigns.
* **Optimizing Contact Strategy:** Determining the optimal number of contacts per customer to maximize deposit subscriptions.
* **Improving Data Collection:** Highlighting the need for better tracking of campaign outcomes to accurately assess campaign effectiveness.
* **Resource Allocation:** Optimizing resource allocation based on seasonal trends in deposit subscriptions.
